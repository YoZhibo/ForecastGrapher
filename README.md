## Training Scripts

- Place the datasets in the ```./dataset/``` folder (for exampleï¼Œ```./dataset/ETTm1.csv```, ```./dataset/PEMS03/PEMS03.npz```). 

- Run the sh file in the `./scripts` folder , using the following command:  `sh ./scripts/ForecastGrapher_***.sh`.

## Model

### Overall Structure

1. Consider each time series as a node and generate a corresponding node embedding. 
2. Employ learnable scalers to partition the node embedding into multiple groups. 
3. Several layers of GFC-GNN are stacked. 
4. Utilize node projection for forecasting.

  ### Learnable Scaler and Group Feature Convolution

  An automatic adjustment of feature distributions can be achieved within CNNs. The GFC mechanism enhances the diversity of node embedding distributions: Convoluting the node feature with two distinct kernel lengths results in two distinct distributions.
